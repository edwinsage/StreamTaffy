Things to do still:

* Use temporary files to pass info from listener.cgi to overlay_event.pl
* Config file creation and docs
* Document template substitutions
* Add a way to create subscriptions with Twitch
* Add additional event types
* Web interface?
* Maybe it runs Talon_Bot when you go live?
* Make requests for user scopes
* Write some code to translate emotes to images


Possible ideas for later:

* Make an installer, once things get more stable
* Go multi-user
